# MarketPlace-Using-Django

In this project, I developed a dynamic online marketplace using Django, a powerful Python web framework. 
The marketplace allows users to buy and sell various items, fostering a community-driven platform for transactions.

Key features of the project include:
ðŸ”¹ User registration and authentication system for secure access.
ðŸ”¹ Item listings with details such as name, description, price, and images.
ðŸ”¹ Search functionality to find items based on keywords and categories.
ðŸ”¹ Conversations and messaging system for buyers and sellers to communicate.
ðŸ”¹ Responsive and user-friendly interface for seamless browsing and interaction.
